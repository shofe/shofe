### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a dedicated learner in the ALX Software Engineering Program, specializing in backend development. My journey into tech is fueled by a lifelong curiosity for how things work and a strong desire to build practical, people-focused solutions.

💡 I started with software engineering because I'm inspired by technology and its endless possibilities—from mobile apps to automation tools, and everything in between. With hands-on experience in IT support, field telecommunications, and a strong hardware foundation, I’m now channeling that into robust software systems.

🚀 **My vision** is to build innovative, reliable, and accessible technology solutions that make life easier for people and power the infrastructure of the future.
